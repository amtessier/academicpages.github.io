*Invited talk for a special session -- "50 Years of SPE: what remains?*

In this talk, I tried to deal with four fundamental questions about how generative phonological grammars are learned -- how learners compile their data, how they choose between grammar hypotheses, how they construct URs and how they handle exceptions. In each case, I discussed how SPE framed, approached or avoided the question, and then sketched to varying degrees of detail how the question and its SPE treatment have addressed in subsequent literature.
