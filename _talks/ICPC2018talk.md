This study reports two English phonological processing tasks -- rhyme judgment and sentence prosody matching -- with children ages 7-11 who received a cochlear implant before age 2, compared to age-matched children with normal hearing. While completing these tasks, childrenâ€™s brain activation was simultaneously registered using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The resulting differences between populations and task conditions, and correlations with some non-linguistic processing measures (backwards digit span), support our ongoing investigation of how individual variation in CI outcomes might be explained.
