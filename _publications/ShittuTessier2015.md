permalink: /publication/ShittuTessier2015.md
excerpt: 'This paper reports a study of tonal perception and attrition in Yoruba (NigerCongo), among children aged 8-15 and their parents
living in an English-dominant environment. The overall results show a rapid loss of tone perception among children, and also indicate grammatical asymmetries (e.g. greater accuracy for
High tone) which match previous work on Yoruba tone.'
