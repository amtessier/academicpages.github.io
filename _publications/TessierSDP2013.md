title: "Developmental trends and L1 effects in early L2 learners' onset cluster production"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/TessierSDP2013
excerpt: 'This study focuses on English onset cluster production in spontaneous speech samples of 10 children aged 5;04–6;09 from Chinese and Hindi/Punjabi first language (L1) backgrounds, each with less than a year of exposure to English. The results suggest commonalities between early second language (L2) learners and both monolingual and adult L2 learners in the location of cluster repair and the sometimes-exceptional treatment of s+stop clusters.'
