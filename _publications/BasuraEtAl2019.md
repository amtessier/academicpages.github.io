publicationText: To be published in
excerpt: 'Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging non-invasive technology used to study cerebral cortex activity.  Being virtually silent and compatible with cochlear implants has helped establish fNIRS as an important tool when investigating auditory cortex as well as cortices involved with language processing in adults and during child development. The purpose of this review article is to summarize key current fNIRS studies to date that have investigated human auditory performance with cochlear implantation and plasticity that may underlie the central percepts of tinnitus.'
