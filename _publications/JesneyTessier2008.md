title: "Gradual learning and faithfulness: consequences of ranked vs. weighted constraints"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/JesneyTessier2008
excerpt: 'This paper investigates a class of restrictive intermediate stages that emerge during L1 phonological acquisition, and argues that these stages are naturally accounted for within a gradual learning model that uses weighted constraints. The particular type of pattern of interest here – Intermediate Faithfulness (IF) stages – involves the preservation of marked structures just in privileged environments. We illustrate this with data from Bat-El (2007), which shows the innovation of morphologically-sensitive phonology during the acquisition of Hebrew.'

This paper investigates a class of restrictive intermediate stages that emerge during L1 phonological acquisition, and argues that these stages are naturally accounted for within a gradual learning model that uses weighted constraints. The particular type of pattern of interest here – Intermediate Faithfulness (IF) stages – involves the preservation of marked structures just in privileged environments. We illustrate this with data from Bat-El (2007), which shows the innovation of morphologically-sensitive phonology during the acquisition of Hebrew.
