title: "The effect of allophonic processes on word recognition: Eye-tracking evidence from Canadian raising"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/FarrisTrimbleTessier2018
excerpt: 'This paper examines the recognition of words that have undergone Canadian Raising and/or intervocalic flapping. Two eye-tracking experiments suggest that listeners are slower to fixate words that have undergone one or more phonological processes within their own Raising dialect, supporting the idea that they must calculate a mapping from surface word forms to more abstract representations.'

This paper examines the recognition of words that have undergone Canadian Raising and/or intervocalic flapping. Two eye-tracking experiments suggest that listeners are slower to fixate words that have undergone one or more phonological processes within their own Raising dialect, supporting the idea that they must calculate a mapping from surface word forms to more abstract representations.
