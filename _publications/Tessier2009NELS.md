title: "UseListedError: a grammatical account of lexical exceptions in phonological acquisition"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Tessier2009NELS
excerpt: 'This paper attempts to provide an account for exceptionally-pronounced words in children’s developing phonologies, situated within an OT error-driven view of phonological learning. The present proposal provides a way to keep exceptional forms beyond the reach of the ‘core’ grammar, while still using an independently-proposed approach to gradual OT learning to progress through and beyond exceptional stages.'
