title: "Motor influences on grammar in an emergentist model of phonology"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/McAllisterByunTessier2016
excerpt: 'This paper focuses on bringing together two literatures that have evolved largely independently. The first explores how speech-motor patterns practiced during babbling
come to be disproportionately represented in the lexicon in children’s earliest stages of meaningful speech. The second posits that abstract elements of phonology – segments, features, and constraints – can be understood
to emerge from generalizations over stored memory traces at a more holistic level. We argue that an emergentist model of phonological learning can be enhanced by incorporating the insight that memory
traces of strings that have been heard and produced are encoded more robustly than strings that have only been heard.'
