This website's main purpose is to let you access whatever academic work I've done in phonology and allied fields. Its current secondary purpose is to lay out the slightly complicated explanation of my affiliations, as they have been the subject of some confusion and with good reason.

Where am I, When and How?
-----
<div class="amtText" markdown="1">
After completing my Ph.D. at Umass Amherst in 2006, I was appointed as an Assistant and then Associate Professor in Linguistics at the University of Alberta for a decade, but in 2015/2016 I resigned from that job for family reasons and moved to mid-Michigan. Over the years 2016-2018, I have been affiliated with the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, as a Lecturer occasionally in Linguistics but mostly in Psychology, and as a Research Investigator at the Center for Human Growth and Development, mostly through the generosity of Ioulia Kovelman. Over this same period I have also been an Adjunct Professor in Linguistics at Simon Fraser University, which has housed my SSHRC-funded Insight grant with co-PI Ashley Farris-Trimble, predominantly kept aloft by postdoctoral fellow Claire Moore-Cantwell, and where I have also taught in the summer. **However!** As of January 2019 I have accepted a new Assistant Professorship in Linguistics at the University of British Columbia, at which point I hope that my affiliation(s) will never confuse anyone again.

What's New?
------
<div class="amtText" markdown="1">
So far this site contains links to my publications, many of which work, and my CV including teaching and advising experience. 
What's still missing are links to talks and posters, and what's very missing is a link to my new UBC lab website, to be appear at some point in 2019. *If any of the links are broken, or if you don't have access to any of them, feel free to email me to get a copy.*

**About my website**
------
<div class="amtText" markdown="1">
This website is based on the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) created by [Stuart Geiger](http://stuartgeiger.com) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). I acquired this site in July 2018 in my quest to create a professional online presence that didn't make me look like the old person who learned html in 2002 that I am, but I am still getting the hang of all aspects of its workings so I apologize in advance for anything that is broken and please send me an email if my website gives you any degree of trouble, grief, a rash, or similar.
