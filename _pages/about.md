<div class="amtText" markdown="1">
Hello and welcome. I am an Assistant Professor of Linguistics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.<p>
** WCCFL38 is coming to UBC in March 2020! Go see <A href="https://wccfl2020.linguistics.ubc.ca/">the WCCFL 2020 conference website</a>!**

The Story of How I Got Here
-----
After completing my Ph.D. at Umass Amherst in 2006, I was appointed as an Assistant and then Associate Professor in Linguistics at the University of Alberta for a decade, but in 2015/2016 I resigned from that job for family reasons and moved to mid-Michigan. Between 2016 and 2018, I was affiliated with the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, as a Lecturer occasionally in Linguistics but mostly in Psychology, and as a Research Investigator at the Center for Human Growth and Development, mostly through the generosity of <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/kovelman.html">Ioulia Kovelman</a>. From 2016-2019 I was also an Adjunct Professor in Linguistics at Simon Fraser University, which has housed my SSHRC-funded Insight grant with co-PI <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/linguistics/people/faculty/farris-trimble.html">Ashley Farris-Trimble</a>, predominantly kept aloft by then-postdoctoral fellow <a href="http://www.clairemoorecantwell.org/">Claire Moore-Cantwell</a> (now faculty at UCLA!). As of January 2019 I am now at UBC and I'm a bit tired of moving around and wearing twelve hats at once so I think I will sit down and stay a while.

What I Do
---
I am primarily a theoretical phonologist who studies acquisition. When I have to put keywords on an abstract, they usually include "constraint-based" and/or "learning algorithms", but I also work on things like lexical avoidance, U-shaped development, L2 production and perception in childhood, prosodic processing with cochlear implants, and shitgibbons. For several years I was an Associate Editor at <a href="https://www.glossa-journal.org/">Glossa</a> (an open access general theoretical linguistics journal), and before that at Lingua before the entire Editorial Board quit and formed Glossa. As of January 2020, I'm an Associate Editor at <a href="https://languagelsa.org/index.php/language"> Language</a>. I have also written an advanced undergraduate textbook about <A href="https://www.macmillanihe.com/page/detail/Phonological-Acquisition/?K=9780230293762">Phonological Acquisition</a> that also teaches the basics of OT along the way.  

What's New?
-----
So far this site contains links to my publications, many of which work, and my brief CV.
What's still missing are links to most talks and posters from before 2016, and what's very missing is a link to my new UBC lab website, to be appear at some point, er, soon. *If any of the links are broken, or if you don't have access to any of them, feel free to email me to get a copy.*

**About my website**
------
This website is based on the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) created by [Stuart Geiger](http://stuartgeiger.com) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). I acquired this site in July 2018 in my quest to create a professional online presence that didn't make me look like the old person who learned html in 2002 that I am, so I apologize for anything that works less well than it should, and please email me so I can help. If you find something on my website that works better than it should, it is probably thanks to <a href="https://rogertessier.org/">this guy</a>.
